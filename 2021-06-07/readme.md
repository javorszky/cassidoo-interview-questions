## Approach

Collect the three numbers into a map with the numbers being key, and the occurence being the value. For each number, increment the value of the map with the key of the number.

Then I start with a number of 1 as a basis, then iterate over the map, and for each key (the numbers passed in), where the value is larger than 1 (ie there's more than one of them), I skip counting. Otherwise I will multiply the previous product with the current number (so the first iteration is going to be 1 (starter product) * whatever number).

At the end I return the product.
