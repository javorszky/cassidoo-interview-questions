> This weekâ€™s question:
> Given three numbers, return their product. But, if one of the numbers is the same as another, it does not count: If two numbers are similar, return the lonely number. If all numbers are same, return 1.
>
> Example:
> ```bash
> $ lonelyNumber(1,2,3)
> $ 6
> 
> $ lonelyNumber(6,6,4)
> $ 4
> 
> $ lonelyNumber(7,7,7)
> $ 1
> ```
