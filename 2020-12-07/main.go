// This week’s question:
// Given two non-negative integers n1 and n2 represented as strings, return the product of n1 and n2, also represented
// as a string. Neither input will start with 0, and don’t just convert it to an integer and do the math that way.
//
// Examples:
//
// $ stringMultiply(“123”, “456”)
// $ “56088”
