This week’s question:
> Given an array of integers arr, a pair (n,m) is called “special” if arr[n] == arr[m], and n < m. Return the number of special pairs. Hint: Nested for loops can work for this one, but a hashmap solution will have a better runtime!

Examples:

```
$ specialPairs([1,2,3,1,1,3])
$ 4 // (0,3), (0,4), (3,4), (2,5)
```
