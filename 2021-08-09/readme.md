> This weekâ€™s question:
>
> Given a grid size, and a set of mines (in pairs of rows and columns), generate the [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) grid for that set of mines. You can use asterisks for mines, and an x for 0!
>
>Example:
> ```shell
> let gridSize = 5
> let mines = [[1, 3], [3, 5], [2, 4]]
> 
> $ generateMinesweeper(gridSize, mines)
> 
> xxxxx
> 11xxx
> *21xx
> 2*21x
> 12*1x
> ```
