> Given two integers, generate a “fibonacci-like” sequence of n digits (where the next number in the pattern is the sum of the previous two numbers). Extra credit: Given a sequence, determine if the sequence is “fibonacci-like”.
>
> Example:
> ```shell
> let n = 5
>
> > fibLike(10, 20, n)
> > [10, 20, 30, 50, 80]
>
> > fibLike(3, 7, n)
> > [3, 7, 10, 17, 27]
> ```
